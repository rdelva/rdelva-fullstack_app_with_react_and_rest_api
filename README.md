# Full Stack App with React and a REST API

In this project I will use React to create a client for an existing school database which is in a form of a REST  API. The application will allow users to administer a school database containing information about courses.

Users can do the following:

<ul>
    <ol>Retrive a List of courses</ol>
    <ol>View detail on a specific course</ol>
    <ol>Create, Update and Delete courses in the database</ol>    
</ul>
